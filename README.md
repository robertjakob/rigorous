# Rigorous

A comprehensive suite of tools aimed at revolutionizing scientific publishing by making it more transparent, cost-effective, and higher quality.

## Mission

Rigorous aims to transform scientific publishing by addressing fundamental inefficiencies and inequities in the current system. Our goal is to create a more efficient, transparent, and accessible publishing ecosystem that better serves both researchers and the public.

## Pain Points and Solutions

### 1. Long Review Cycles
**Pain Points:**
- Slows down innovation and knowledge dissemination
- Inefficient use of public funding
- Delays in implementing research findings

**Solution:**
- AI-assisted pre-screening of manuscripts
- Automated initial review processes
- Smart suggestions for improvements
- Streamlined review workflows

### 2. High Publication Costs
**Pain Points:**
- Costs thousands of USD to make research publicly available
- Inefficient and inappropriate use of public funding
- Creates barriers to knowledge access

**Solution:**
- Lower pricing through automation
- Removal of unnecessary human involvement
- Elimination of traditional publishing company overhead
- Open access by default

### 3. Intransparent Contribution and Lack of Rewards for Peer-Reviewers
**Pain Points:**
- Peer-reviewers receive no compensation for their time
- No way to showcase review contributions
- Lack of recognition for valuable feedback

**Solution:**
- Transparent version control showing manuscript evolution
- AI evaluation of reviewer contributions
- Public showcase of reviewer expertise
- Attribution system for review contributions

### 4. Inefficient Matchmaking Between Manuscripts and Reviewers
**Pain Points:**
- Manual reviewer selection by editors
- Time-consuming email-based coordination
- Suboptimal reviewer-manuscript matching

**Solution:**
- KANBAN-style platform for manuscript listings
- Self-selection system for reviewers
- Smart matching algorithms
- Automated coordination

### 5. Lack of Quality Due to Set-in-Stone Academic Research
**Pain Points:**
- Common errors in review process
- Limited post-publication feedback channels
- Research interpretation limited to past context
- Difficulty in correcting published errors

**Solution:**
- Post-publication feedback system
- Reader highlight and suggestion features
- Author-controlled update mechanism
- Integration with future research context

### 6. Writing Manuscripts
**Pain Points:**
- Slow and labor-intensive writing process
- Time-consuming literature review
- Difficulty in integrating prior research

**Solution:**
- AI-powered writing support tools
- Automated literature discovery and integration
- Specialized "Overleaf-like" platform
- User-friendly interface similar to Word

### 7. Manuscript Tracking Systems
**Pain Points:**
- Complex submission processes
- Poor user interfaces
- Redundant data entry
- Inefficient workflow management

**Solution:**
- Streamlined manuscript upload process
- Smart auto-population of fields
- Proactive checklist presentation
- Integration with writing tools
- Single-platform solution from writing to submission
